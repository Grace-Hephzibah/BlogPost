# BlogPost
My first step in Web Designing.

Hi! I started a Udemy course on HTML and CSS with the Instructor Jonas Schmedtmann. 

The course is amazing and I used all what I learnt to build a blog.

The entire text is blind text and photo is also not mine. I will give some valuable text maybe later.

I have also started learning CSS and I have styled the Blog Post.
